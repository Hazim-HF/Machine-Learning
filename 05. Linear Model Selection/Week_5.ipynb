    "Linear models still can do astonishingly well compared to non-linear models. This chapter will explore other types of fitting besides least squares because they can give better prediction accuracy and interpretability.\n",

    "* Subset Selection - Choose a subset of the predictors\n",
    "* Shrinkage (regularization) - Fit all predictors but limit their size. Coefficients can go to 0.\n",
    "* Dimension Reduction - project the predictors into a smaller subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Subset Selection\n",
    "Fit all possible models $2^p$ and take the best model using cross-validated\n",
    "prediction error, Cp, AIC, BIC, or adjusted $R^2$. This can be impossible with large enough p\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stepwise Selection - Forward, Backward and both\n",
    "Because of computational limitation a simpler method of adding or subtracting the best predictor to the current model is employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Selection\n",
    "Start with an empty model and choose on predictor to add to the model based on best adjusted $R^2$ or other similar metric. Continue adding variables until no improvement in adjusted $R^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A variation to this is to retain each model at each step and use $R^2$ (not adjusted) as the metric. This will build p models. Then use cross validation with $R^2$ to pick the best model of those p models built from forward selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward Selection\n",
    "Similar to forward selection but start with all predictors in model and remove one at a time until adjusted $R^2$ is maximized or alternatively, find p models with $R^2$ and then use cross validation to pick best of the p models.\n",

    "\n",
    "But alternatively to cross validation, we can punish the training error statistics so in theory they can give us insight on what the test error will be. There have been several statistics developed to give us insight as to what the model will do for unseen errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 most popular are AIC, BIC, Mallows Cp and Adjusted R^2. AIC, BIC and Cp all have similar formulas that inflate the error for more predictors and a higher estimated variance. Adjusted R squared lowers the R^2 by each additional predictor in the model. All 4 of these statistics are 'classical' model selectors and were commonly used.\n",
